          Citric acid is a natural organic acid found in citrus fruits such as
          lemons, oranges, and limes.

          It is widely used in the food industry as a flavor enhancer, acidulant,
          and preservative due to its tart and refreshing taste.

          Citric acid is safe for consumption when used in moderation and is
          considered a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food additive by
          regulatory agencies worldwide.
