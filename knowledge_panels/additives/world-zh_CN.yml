          碳酸钠（也称E500）是化合物，主要作为膨松剂用于食品加工。在制作烘培食品过程中，碳酸钠与酸接触后会释放二氧化碳，可使食品变得膨松。
          小苏打中通常含有碳酸钠，它们能够调节食品的酸碱性，防止食品酸性过高，或碱性过高。在烹饪界，碳酸钠还能改善食物的质地和结构，例如，面条就是改变了面筋网状结构而制成的。
          碳酸钠通常认为是安全的，无毒的，在食品中按正常量使用。

          黄原胶（编号E415）是一种天然的多糖，是通过发酵从糖类物质中产生，通常作为增稠剂和稳定剂用于食品行业。
          这种用途广泛的食品添加剂改善了像色拉酱、酱汁、无麸质烘焙食品等食物的质地，防止它们的成分分离。
          即使大量食用黄原胶，也是安全的。

          单、双甘油酯（编号E471）是食品添加剂，作为食品乳化剂用于各类食品加工。
          这种化合物包含了甘油分子，此类分子和一个或二个脂肪酸链结合，有助于稳定、调和水性与油性食材。E471能改善像麦淇淋、烘培食品、冰淇淋等食品的质地和保存期，确保食品丝滑和拥有品质稳定的质地。
          E471在监管部门设定的使用限制内食用，是安全的。

          Sodium hydrogen carbonate, also known as E500ii, is a food additive
          commonly used as a leavening agent.

          When added to recipes, it releases carbon dioxide gas upon exposure to
          heat or acids, causing dough to rise and resulting in a light, fluffy
          texture in baked goods.

          It is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities when
          used in appropriate quantities and poses no significant health risks when
          consumed in typical food applications.

          Guar gum (E412) is a natural food additive derived from guar beans.

          This white, odorless powder is valued for its remarkable thickening and
          stabilizing properties, making it a common ingredient in various food
          products, including sauces, dressings, and ice creams.

          When used in moderation, guar gum is considered safe for consumption,
          with no known adverse health effects.

          Potassium sorbate (E202) is a synthetic food preservative commonly used
          to extend the shelf life of various food products.

          It works by inhibiting the growth of molds, yeast, and some bacteria,
          preventing spoilage. When added to foods, it helps maintain their
          freshness and quality.

          Some studies have shown that when combined with nitrites, potassium
          sorbate have genotoxic activity in vitro. However, potassium sorbate is
          generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities.

          Diphosphates (E450) are food additives often utilized to modify the
          texture of products, acting as leavening agents in baking and preventing
          the coagulation of canned food.

          These salts can stabilize whipped cream and are also found in powdered
          products to maintain their flow properties. They are commonly present in
          baked goods, processed meats, and soft drinks.

          Derived from phosphoric acid, **they're part of our daily phosphate
          intake, which often surpasses recommended levels** due to the prevalence
          of phosphates in processed foods and drinks.

          Excessive phosphate consumption is linked to health issues, such as
          **impaired kidney function** and **weakened bone health**. Though diphosphates
          are generally regarded as safe when consumed within established
          acceptable daily intakes, it's imperative to monitor overall phosphate
          consumption to maintain optimal health.

          Carrageenan (E407), derived from red seaweed, is widely employed in the
          food industry as a gelling, thickening, and stabilizing agent, notably in
          dairy and meat products.

          It can exist in various forms, each imparting distinct textural
          properties to food.

          However, its degraded form, often referred to as poligeenan, **has raised
          health concerns** due to its potential inflammatory effects and its
          classification as a **possible human carcinogen (Group 2B)** by the
          International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

          Nevertheless, food-grade carrageenan has been deemed safe by various
          regulatory bodies when consumed in amounts typically found in food.

          Pectins (E440) are natural carbohydrates, predominantly found in fruits,
          that act as gelling agents in the food industry, creating the desirable
          jelly-like texture in jams, jellies, and marmalades.

          Pectins stabilize and thicken various food products, such as desserts,
          confectioneries, and beverages, ensuring a uniform consistency and
          quality.

          Recognized as safe by various health authorities, pectins have been
          widely used without notable adverse effects when consumed in typical
          dietary amounts.
