<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:24"><strong>What is Nutri-Score?</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:84">Nutri-Score is a logo that aims to inform you about the nutritional quality of food.&nbsp;The color code ranges from dark green (A) for the healthiest products to dark red (E) for the least healthy.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:27"><strong>Why is Nutri-Score changing?</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:70">The Nutri-Score formula is evolving to provide better recommendations:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="11:1-12:54">
    <li data-sourcepos="11:1-12:54"><strong>Better evaluate all drinks</strong>The comparative scores of milk,&nbsp;sweetened dairy drinks,&nbsp;and plant-based drinks have been better differentiated in the new algorithm.</li>
    <li data-sourcepos="13:1-14:53"><strong>Better ranking of drinks</strong>Sugar content is better taken into account and favors low-sugar drinks.&nbsp;Sweeteners will also be penalized:&nbsp;diet sodas will be downgraded from a B rating to between C and E.&nbsp;Water remains the recommended drink.</li>
    <li data-sourcepos="15:1-16:82"><strong>Salt and sugar penalized</strong>Products that are too sweet or too salty will see their rating further downgraded.</li>
    <li data-sourcepos="17:1-18:70"><strong>Prioritization of oils and fish</strong>The rating of some fatty fish and oils rich in good fats will improve.</li>
    <li data-sourcepos="19:1-21:0"><strong>Limit red meat</strong>Red meat consumption should be limited.&nbsp;This is why poultry will be comparatively better ranked.</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="22:1-22:69"><strong>How to differentiate between old Nutri-Score and new calculation?</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos="24:1-24:35">From now on,&nbsp;the logo can display a &quot;New calculation&quot; mention to clarify that it is indeed the new calculation.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="26:1-26:50"><strong>Where to find the new Nutri-Score calculation?</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos="28:1-28:122">Nutri-Score is in use in several countries:&nbsp;Germany,&nbsp;Belgium,&nbsp;Spain,&nbsp;France,&nbsp;Luxembourg,&nbsp;the Netherlands,&nbsp;and Switzerland.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="30:1-30:92">Manufacturers have until 2026 at the latest to replace the old calculation with the new one.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="32:1-32:147">Without waiting,&nbsp;you can already find the new calculation in the Open Food Facts application,&nbsp;even if the manufacturers have not updated the score.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="34:1-34:24"><strong>What does not change</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos="36:1-36:120">Nutri-Score is a score designed to measure nutritional quality.&nbsp;It is complementary to the NOVA group on ultra-processed foods (also present in the application).</p>
<p data-sourcepos="38:1-38:63">For manufacturers, the display of Nutri-Score remains optional.</p>
