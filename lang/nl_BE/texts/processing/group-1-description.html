<h3>NOVA-Groep 1: Onverwerkt of minimaal verwerkt voedsel</h3>
<p>Onbewerkte (of natuurlijke) voedingsmiddelen zijn eetbare delen van planten
(zaden, vruchten, bladeren, stengels, wortels) of van dieren (spier,
slachtafval, eieren, melk) en ook schimmels, algen en water, direct uit de natuur. </p>
<p>Minimally processed foods are natural foods altered by processes that include removal of inedible or unwanted parts, and drying, crushing, grinding, fractioning, filtering, roasting, boiling, non-alcoholic fermentation, pasteurization, refrigeration, chilling, freezing, placing in containers and vacuum-packaging. These processes are designed to preserve natural foods, to make them suitable for storage, or to make them safe or edible or more pleasant to consume. Many unprocessed or minimally processed foods are prepared and cooked at home or in restaurant kitchens in combination with processed culinary ingredients as dishes or meals.</p>
